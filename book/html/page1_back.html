<h2>Entry 2: Choosing a New Self</h2>
<p><strong>Entry Date: Aboard Ship</strong></p>
<p class="firstletter">
  The king's castle, family, friends. These are some of the things I had to
  leave behind when leaving for this new world that was promised to me. I felt
  my future looked brighter when looking away from the coast over the water. A
  new name, it's the first thing they asked of me. I gave in; "if I'm starting
  over, this is all but illogical. A new name I must have" this choice was
  simple yet difficult as well. As I sat on deck during peaceful early mornings,
  I kept thinking of different options. Options that would all feel anything but
  familiar to me. How can someone so determined towards the future be stuck on a
  mere name. Two days before we arrived it came to me as I was watching the
  white dots, spread across the night sky; Our national crest on the ship's
  flag. Starcrest, that's what I'll name myself, this is who I will and already
  have become.
