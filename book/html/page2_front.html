<h2>Entry 3: Arrival and Skepticism</h2>
<p><strong>Entry Date: Arrival at North Port</strong></p>
<p class="firstletter">
  Arriving on the north port we were guided and immediately greeted by the king.
  Who was oh so friendly, I remained skeptical, first I have to see what was
  promised to us and then he'll have my praise in return. Bowing for now was the
  only option to remain unnoticed amongst my fellow travelers and newly made
  adventurers. Infrastructure was already built, the port was scattered with
  many of man, some looking skinnier than others, but all cheerful and happy. I
  knew what I had to do next before leaving to find a settlement where I could
  belong. A cup of Tea, that's what I'll need for now.
